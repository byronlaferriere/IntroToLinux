This assignment required the student to create a script using vi editor that would alter the files previously created. The first step that was addressed was the creation of threedifferent files, in seperate folders, that were created with three different commands. The three commmands that were used to complete this step were: (>) the redirection can create a new file on its own and send the information requested into that file, touch (filename.txt) creates a file and then the (>>) double redirection is able to send the information to this new file created by touch, and lastly I used echo and the (|) pipeline to write the time file. The next step requested that we copy and rename selected files from the OLD directory to the BACKUP directory. By using directpath idenfication, I was able to select the file and destination folder, while also renaming the file. Next, it was requested that the files from the folder NEW be moved into BACKUP folder without renaming them. This was easily done with one command, because the 'mv' command allows for multiple file selection before the new folder destination is chosen. Lastly, the script needed to delete the remaining files in the NEW folder. There was only one file remaining left in NEW, which was created in our script. The file OLD_Content was deleted by also using a directpath command to successfully our script.
