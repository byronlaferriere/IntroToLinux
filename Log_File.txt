I. Navigate: The first step that you will provide evidence for in your log file is to view the following using Linux commands: 
a. Current directory:
pwd 
b. Current user: 
whoami
 
II. File Permissions: Locate the “whoownsme.txt” file and confirm that all users have the ability to execute the file. 
Find . -name "who*"
chmod a+x ~/workspace/whoownsme.txt (a specifies all user groups/ +x adds execution rights)
ls -al (read after -) 

III. Create Files: Demonstrate your ability to utilize various Linux commands to create text files in unique ways. Create these files in the workspace directory. Ensure the commands in your log file 
show that your text files were created with two different methods. Create the following files: 
a. A text file using the vi editor that includes a paragraph of text explaining what you believe is the most complicated part of the final project 
vi
i
" "
<esc>
:w FinalProjectParagraph
:x
b. A text file showing the current month, day, and time (title this file Time_File.txt) 
echo `date` > Time_File.txt 

IV. In the workspace directory, create a new directory titled Milestone_Files. 
mkdir Milestone_Files 

V. Modify and Move: Utilize Linux commands to rename files and move them to the Milestone_Files directory. Add “_MOVED” to the end of the file name. Remember that your modified files should use an appropriate naming 
convention such as “XXXX_XXXX_MOVED.txt.” 

mv FinalProjectParagraph Milestone_Files
cd Milestone_Files
mv FinalProjectParagraph FinalProjectParagraph_MOVED

mv Time_File.txt Milestone_Files
cd Milestone_Files 
mv Time_File.txt Time_File_MOVED 

VI. Create a log file of all the commands you have utilized to this point. Title this file Log_File.txt and download it for submission.
nano Log_File.txt
